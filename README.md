# ProgressTracker

## Overview

The Weighted Progress Tracker ‚Äî v1.0 is a desktop productivity app written in Python with Tkinter. Unlike a simple to-do list, this tool is designed for students, professionals, and anyone managing multiple assignments or projects with different priorities.

You can track tasks not just by completion, but by weight, estimated effort (hours), and deadlines. This gives you a more accurate picture of how much work remains ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre finishing a college course, balancing freelance projects, or handling personal goals.

At the top of the app, you can set a personal goal statement and add an optional goal image for visual motivation. The app also provides weekly views, notifications, and filtering by tags, making it a full-featured lightweight project manager.

## Key Features

### Three progress modes
  - Weighted (progress by task weight)
  - Unweighted (simple task counts)
  - Hours-weighted (progress by estimated hours)
  
### Goal panel
  - Write a goal statement at the top of the app
  - Add an optional image (PNG/GIF) for extra motivation

### Weekly planner view
  - See tasks due today, tomorrow, and the upcoming week
  - Urgency badges: üî• today, ‚ö† tomorrow, ‚è≥ soon, ‚Ä¢ later

### Tags & filtering
  - Organize tasks by custom tags
  - Filter your view by tag

### Notifications & reminders
  - Warnings for overdue and upcoming tasks
  - Optional sound alerts (Windows only)

### Dark mode theme
  - Sleek, modern look for day or night

### Autosave & persistence
  - Work is saved automatically to JSON
  - Load previous state instantly when reopening

### CSV import/export
  - Import tasks from a spreadsheet
  - Export progress for reports or backups

### Inline editing
